# Ambidex customer dashboard
Dashboard for customer that I created for Ambidex company.

Dashboard is a calendar function to help customers visualize the sequences/runs in their stores. It allows to block a time window (to block a run) in case there is planned service for their fridge/freeze system. Furthermore you can see upcoming events and all historical runs - what date,time and in which store they've been executed. 

There is also a functionality to get a personalized report of previous month with most important results which you can download or print directly from dashboard. 

Also a(n unfinished) feature for chart/graph showing with real time data through connecting to a mqtt-broker.
